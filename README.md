Reflection:

While coding this assignment, the most amount of time taken was on the nav bar and the footer. Styling the nav bar required a lot of work, especially aligning the Logo to the left, Work and About links in the centre and the Resume button at the end. The solution was just the placement of the different nav links in different DIVs and using flex.
I've also added animations for the logo on hover, as well as have the logo change to a wink when it was tapped, on mobile. This required javascript to complete which I looked up and incorporated in my code. Changed the hamburger icon to an X when expanded and colour coded the same to fit the brand colours.

The showreel video is yet to be completed, but I've ensured that I make it autoplay on mute (just like I'd have with the final) with the 3 seconds that I have for now.

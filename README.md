## REFLECTION:

While coding this assignment, the most amount of time taken was on the Navigation Bar. Styling the nav bar required a lot of work, especially aligning the Logo with content, Work and About links in the centre and the Resume button at the end. The solution was just placement of the nav links in different DIVs and using flex.

I've also made the logo wink on hover for desktop, as well as have the logo wink when it was tapped, on mobile. This required javascript to complete which I looked up and incorporated in my code. Changed the hamburger icon to an X when expanded ( using 3 spans and transition animations) and colour coded the same to fit the brand colours.

The showreel video is only a teaser for now, but I've ensured that I make it autoplay on mute (just like I'd have with the final video) with the 3 seconds that I have for now.

### Nav bar that displays on desktop only:

I couldn't get the entire "Work" dropdown to have a single border like on mobile and it wasn't looking right. So I styled it slightly differently. To do that, I've added a second nav bar for desktop which would display at a certain size, for the "Work & About" links. Only the Desktop version would have shadow. There was also no responsive options on Bootstrap for shadow or colour.

This also made it easier for me to add another image tag for javascript to change the logo: On 'tap' for mobile, and on 'hover' for desktop.
